% \section{Problem Domain}
% In the domain of program analysis, it is always advised to perform code optimizations to the paths that have higher likelihood of occuring in a given run of
% the program. This prioritization process can be tackled by identifying hot paths (paths of high frequency of execution) and cold paths (paths of low frequency
% of execution) \cite{baba2007design, ball1996efficient, duesterwald2000software, merten1999hardware}. The importance of identifying hot paths arises from the
% empirical observation that most or all of the execution time of a typical program is spent along a small percentage of program paths (i.e. hot paths).
% 
% \section{Existing Solutions}
% Static profiling has been commonly used in the literature to identify hot paths. Although static profiling can be very useful and successful, it faces many
% practical challenges:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item the frequent lack of appropriate workloads for programs,
%   \item the questionable degree to which they are indicative of actual usage,
%   \item the inability of such tools evaluate program modules or individual paths in isolation,
%   \item and the extra work done by the programmer/developer to write code that generates program profiles.
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Analyzing additional information, e.g data flow analysis \cite{boogerd2008use},  is also a common practice that helps identify hot paths.
% 
% \section{Interesting Solution}
% Raymond Buse and Westley Weimer \cite{buse2009road} propose a very interesting approach to the problem of hot paths identification. The proposed solution is
% modelled as a classification problem, where a path is classified as \textsf{high frequency}, or \textsf{low frequency}. They used a Bayesian classifier for
% the
% learning process, where the classifier is trained by analyzing a set of feature-vectors. Each feature-vector consists of the numerical counts of occurances of
% features that the authors considered sufficient to capture the state changing behavior related to path frequency.
% 
% \section{Project Idea}
% I would like to investigate the work done in \cite{buse2009road} more, since they did not provide enough explanation for their Bayesian learning process. I
% would also like to survey similar methods used to identify hot paths. Based on my findings from investigating the work in \cite{buse2009road} and other
% literature, I would like to improve on those techniques and push them one step further.
